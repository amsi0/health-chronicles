        <h1>Probiotic Yeast Saccharomyces boulardii: A Wonderful Probiotic</h1>
        <p>
            Probiotic Yeast Saccharomyces boulardii: A probiotic unlike others with wide-ranging benefits. The human gut is more than a site of mechanical transit, biochemical changes, and gradual digestion. Recent studies show it is also concerned with metabolic regulation, immune modulation, and neurological health. For instance, there’s a gut-brain axis that links what happens in the intestines with <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wVmr-ujM831olJoyT62dyBT62Vrvulj7sRCFYC8pms/edit?usp=sharing">neurotransmitters</a> and brain function. Since the gut has associated lymphoid tissue, it also regulates how immune cells interact with microorganisms.

        <p>
            No wonder there’s recently been a special interest in dysbiosis, the technical name for gut microbiota disturbances. These problems with gut microbiota are linked to gastrointestinal diseases, systemic inflammation, and sometimes neurologic symptoms. In this context, probiotics are emerging as tools to restore gut balance. Increasing evidence shows these beneficial microorganisms can improve health outcomes and sometimes solve underlying medical diseases.

            There is a wide range of probiotic bacteria, but some probiotic yeasts, such as Saccharomyces boulardii, are also considered beneficial. This robust yeast strain differs from other probiotics because it is not a bacteria. As such, it can survive many antibiotics and has proven resistant to gastric acids. Saccharomyces boulardii is a probiotic unlike others, and this blog will help you understand some reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            After reading this article, you will understand why this yeast is essential and how to use it. We will explore its therapeutic applications and how it can be used to prevent various diseases.

        <h2>What everyone should know about Saccharomyces boulardii</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://amsi0.github.io/fancy-igfonts/">full name</a> of Saccharomyces boulardii is Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii. In other words, this strain is a variation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. That’s why we have such a long name. But this probiotic is so popular that people simply call it Saccharomyces boulardii, for short. To simplify things further, we can refer to it as S. boulardii.
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, one of the <a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/joe-breath/episodes/Instagram-Fonts-Generator-e2q75jn/a-abjnpep">main features</a> of this strain is that we’re dealing with a type of yeast. Most probiotics are considered beneficial bacteria, but this one is a fungus. It has an oval-to-round shape and is regarded as an excellent source of nutrients. As a fungus, there are structural and reproduction differences between S. boulardii and other probiotics.
        </p>
        <p>
            This yeast was isolated in the early 20th century and found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTbgzhh69LtYjnGZeu8g_2Rn079X2QKfQ2meBLPdc8ffVr8pL3Sk477N3DifWe3tCFp_iQ9ULtMdUTm/pubhtml">tropical fruits</a>. As a yeast, S. boulardii has a thick cell wall and an oval shape. As opposed to microbes, yeast reproduces sexually, but S. boulardii can also reproduce asexually. The cell wall of this yeast is very robust, and it is made of mannoproteins and beta-glucans. These substances help S. boulardii adhere to the intestinal mucosa. They also resist gastric acidity, bile salt, and other environmental stresses. That’s one of the reasons why this probiotic has a very high survival rate, and a high proportion of what you ingest will survive and reach the gut.
